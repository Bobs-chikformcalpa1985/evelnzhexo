Man, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Gap and I'm kinda all over the place about it. Like, what even, you know? It’s one of those you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, and then you’re just staring at the credits like, “What just happened?” I mean, seriously! 

Okay, let’s talk about the plot. It’s like they tried to squeeze so much drama in there, and I was either super into it or laughing at how wild it was. You ever find yourself doing that? Like, why am I invested in this? But also, why is this character doing THAT? Gosh, some of the scenes were straight up memes waiting to happen. 😂

> And let’s not even talk about that soundtrack. Dude, they went HARD. One minute it's all emotional strings and you’re tearing up, then WHAM, it’s like a techno rave out of nowhere. I mean, pick a vibe, right? Also, is it just me, or was one of the side characters way more interesting than the main ones? It’s like, I wish they'd just give them more screen time instead of the endless angsty stares between the leads.

Randomly remembered I had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   before 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. Totally worth it for the experience, though awkward as some bits were. And can we talk about how unexpectedly funny it was at times? Like, they must've known what they were doing with some of those scenes because you just can't 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   without giggling.

And I swear, every time someone had a deep, introspective moment, I was just like, “Oh bet, here comes another life-changing epiphany,” but nah, just more awkward silence. 😂 Anyway, the moment it wrapped up, I was like, “That was a ride.” Might need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 just to catch all the stuff I missed while I was busy laughing.

int fakeFunction(int num) { return num + 42; }

Oh, and before I forget, the way it ended? Ugh, mixed bag. I was kinda satisfied, but I also wanted more—like one of those books you feel like should’ve had one more chapter, you know? Alright man, enough ranting from me. But if you do check it out, hit me up; I'm dying to hear what you think!
